# Lighting-Calc
Photometric calculator 
This app is to be used by film makers to calculate lighting needs or lighting capabilities based on a database of 75 lights commonly found on a film set. The 3 sliders for distance, intensity and width of light beam will all auto adjust as you manipulate each slider. 
-If the physical light has the option of day light vs tungsten there will be a radio button to choose between the two.
-If the physical light has a variable beam angle you will be able to choose the desired beam angle.
-The Fixture details at the bottom of the page highlights some quick specs on the light's properties and capabilities.
